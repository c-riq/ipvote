    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This website is committed to respecting your privacy. We want to be transparent about how we collect and use your information, particularly when you interact with our voting feature.</p>
    <p>We do not use cookies. And we do not track users across different websites.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect for every vote, which will be shared with the public:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Address</strong>: When you use our voting functionality, we automatically record your IP address. This information helps us ensure the integrity of our voting system and prevent multiple votes from a single source.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone number</strong>: When you use our phone number verification service, we record your phone number. This information helps us ensure the integrity of our voting system and prevent multiple votes from a single source.</li>
        <li><strong>hCaptcha Response</strong>: We use hCaptcha to prevent automated voting. When you complete a captcha, your responses are processed by hCaptcha. For more information about how hCaptcha handles your data, please visit <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy">hCaptcha's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Nonce</strong>: A unique identifier to allow determining the rough location of the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Rough location by latency triangulation</strong>: By measuring the time it takes for internet packets to travel 
            from the user to our servers, we can determine the rough location of the user. This is much less accurate than using GPS, 
            with a radius of uncertainty of much more than 100km. Unlike GPS, these measurements cannot be manipulated by the user.</li>
        <li><strong>GPS coordinates</strong>: If you enable GPS geolocation, we may collect the location (latitude and longitude) that your computer proclaims. 
            This information helps us provide more accurate and relevant voting results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information:</h2>
    <p>We use your IP address to verify and validate voting submissions on our platform and allow any internet user to inspect voting data.</p>
    <p>We use the IP address together with Geo IP data as supportive evidence for validating the rough geographic location of the user.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention:</h2>
    <p>Your IP address will be retained only for as long as necessary to administer and safeguard the voting feature. After this period, your information will be deleted from our systems.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing:</h2>
    <p>All voting data will be shared publicly to allow for independent verification and analysis of the results.
        In the public data, IP addresses will be redacted by 4 digits, i.e. 123.456.78.90 -> 123.456.07X.XXX.   
        This means the data set does not reveal the exact IP address of the voter, but only that the vote could have been 
        submitted from any of the 2550 IP addresses in the 123.456.07X.XXX range.
        Likewise, phone numbers will be redacted by 6 digits, i.e. +49123 4567890 -> +49123 4XXXXXX. 
        This means the data set does not reveal the exact phone number of the voter, but only that the vote could have been 
        submitted from any of the 1'000'000 phone numbers in the +49123 4XXXXXX range.
    </p>

    <h2>Payment Processing:</h2>
    <p>For premium features, we use Stripe as our payment processor. When you make a payment, you will be redirected to Stripe's secure payment interface. Stripe collects and processes your payment information directly - we never see or store your full credit card details. We only receive basic transaction details and a reference ID from Stripe.</p>
    <p>For more information about how Stripe handles your data, please visit <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent:</h2>
    <p>By ticking the "I accept the privacy policy ..." check box, you agree to this privacy policy, the collection of your IP address, and the processing of your captcha responses by hCaptcha.</p>

    <p>As there is no user registration, revoking consent requires prooving that you are either the owner of an IP address or prooving 
        that you were assigned an IP address by a third party at the time of voting. Otherwise we cannot verify whether you are the same 
        person as the one whose vote you intend to revoke.
    </p>
