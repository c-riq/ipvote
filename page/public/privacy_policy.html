    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This website is committed to respecting your privacy. We want to be transparent about how we collect and use your information, particularly when you interact with our voting feature.</p>
    <p>We do not use cookies. And we do not track users across different websites.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect for every vote:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Address</strong>: When you use our voting functionality, we automatically record your IP address. This information helps us ensure the integrity of our voting system and prevent multiple votes from a single source.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect if users enable geolocation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nonce</strong>: A unique identifier to allow determining the rough location of the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Rough location by latency triangulation</strong>: By measuring the time it takes for internet packets to travel 
            from the user to our servers, we can determine the rough location of the user. This is much less accurate than using GPS, 
            with a radius of uncertainty of much more than 100km. Unlike GPS, these measurements cannot be manipulated by the user.</li>
        <li><strong></strong>GPS coordinates</strong>: If you enable geolocation, we may collect the location (latitude and longitude) that your computer proclaims. 
            This information helps us provide more accurate and relevant voting results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information:</h2>
    <p>We use your IP address to verify and validate voting submissions on our platform and allow any internet user to inspect voting data.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention:</h2>
    <p>Your IP address will be retained only for as long as necessary to administer and safeguard the voting feature. After this period, your information will be deleted from our systems.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing:</h2>
    <p>All voting data will be shared publicly to allow for independent verification and analysis of the results.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent:</h2>
    <p>By using the voting functionality on our website, you agree to this privacy policy and the collection of your IP address.</p>

    <p>As there is no user registration, revoking consent requires prooving that you are either the owner of an IP address or prooving 
        that you were assigned an IP address by a third party at the time of voting. Otherwise we cannot verify whether you are the same 
        person as the one whose vote you intend to revoke.
    </p>
